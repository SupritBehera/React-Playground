# React-Playground
Files I'm playing around with whilst learning React primarily from the Net Ninja YouTube course. 

Its quite disorganised, since I did not know earlier that I might have to document them, so for now its pretty much just a dump of the files currently on my laptop which I was playing around with while watching the React Net Ninja Course. I omitted the `node-modules` folder which has present in each of the three project files, since its a folder having over 40k files, but you can get it locally by running `npx create-react-app [app-name]` in the project directory

I'll be making a proper well organised repo once I know enough React to make a toy project with it
